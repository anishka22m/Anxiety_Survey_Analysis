# ðŸ§  Stress & Anxiety Prediction from Mental Health Survey Data

> **Topic:** Machine Learning-Based Analysis and Prediction of Mental Stress & Anxiety  
> **Author:** Anishka Verma
> **Year:** 2024

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This repository contains the complete notebook-based workflow for predicting and analyzing **stress and anxiety levels** using a real-world mental health survey dataset. It is structured in two main Jupyter Notebooks:

- ðŸ“Š `AnalysisAndVisualization_AnxietyStressLevels_Survey.ipynb` â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), cleaning, feature understanding.
- ðŸ¤– `ModelBuilding_AnxietyStressLevels_Survey.ipynb` â€“ Model development, training, evaluation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

- Understand the relationship between **daily habits**, **demographics**, and **mental health conditions**.
- Use ML techniques to predict whether a person is likely to experience:
  - **Stress**
  - **Anxiety**
- Build a reproducible ML pipeline using Python.

## ðŸ§© Dataset Overview

- ðŸ“š Source: Created the Survey and circulated for real life responses 
- ðŸŽ¯ Target Variables:
  - `Stress Level`
  - `Anxiety Level`
- ðŸ§  Features include:
  - Sleep duration
  - Social life
  - Exercise
  - Screen time
  - Academic pressure
  - Diet
  - Gender and age
- ðŸ‘¤ Total entries: 103

## ðŸ“Š EDA Highlights

- **Correlation analysis** reveals strong inverse relationship between:
  - Sleep vs. Stress
  - Physical Activity vs. Anxiety
- **Distribution plots** show:
  - Higher stress among females and students with low physical activity.
  - Poor diet and screen addiction link to high anxiety levels.
- **Outlier handling** and **missing value imputation** performed.

## ðŸ¤– Modeling Approach

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1. | Preprocessing â€“ Label encoding, feature scaling |
| 2. | Data Split â€“ Train-test (e.g., 80-20) |
| 3. | Models â€“ Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN |
| 4. | Evaluation â€“ Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report |
| 5. | Final Selection â€“ Best-performing model based on F1-score |

ðŸ“Œ Additional Notes:
- Hyperparameter tuning performed using GridSearchCV.
- Random Forest gave highest balanced accuracy across classes.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings

- Students with <6 hrs of sleep and high screen time (>6 hrs) showed ~80% likelihood of being stressed or anxious.
- Physical exercise and a structured routine are the strongest **protective factors**.
- Social support correlates inversely with stress levels.
